# TODOS
* Split board.engine tests from chess.engine.tests
* Proper README.MD for each project
* HIgh level readme.md in root
* 
* Publish WebAPI somewhere
* Put in github and hook up to my teamcity for automated build and deployment
* Design docs

* Need to this to do more comprehensive testing against a larger database of games, think there are still some edge cases around castling that need resolving, need to get PGN parsing up and running to parse a ton (10000's) of games.

* Integration test library for the webapi
	* Not much to test in this as the controllers are VERY light but should check they return something

## PGN2JSON Library
* Implement PGN Parsing, base on old version

## SPIKER/Console Player
* Can I reuse anything from the old consoleplayer? Do I want to?
* Keep it simple, do not create the console window library you keep thinking about:)
	* Proper menu/command system , TBD
	* Save game ability


## Chess.Engine
* better error handling in ChessGame
* Move history
	* Enhance enpassant rule to ensure enemy pawn did it's double step the previous turn
	* Enhance castline move validation to ensure king and castle haven't moved and king doesn't move through check
	* Stalemate detection
	* PGN output (optional)
* PGN Move support
	* Dependent on the PGNParser/PGN2JSON
	* Already have the list of moves to query now so just need the parsed text to match against

* Still need to seperate out NextPlayer logic from the Board

* Performance tests
	* Add some multithreading where approriate around the path regeneration mechanisms
* Invalid board state detection (should be able to be turned off) to allow custom boards without kings
* Undo/Redo support
	* Advanced Feature: Branched Undo/Redo

## Chess.WebAPI
* better error handling in ChessGame


# CONSOLE STUFF SUPPORT

* Dynamic board and piece size
* Proper menu system
*	Debug options to dump moves/paths etc.
* Better error handling
* Screen layout
